# Examples

- [Examples by comparison to other libraries](./comparison.md).

  Since Cappa can be fairly different from other libraries, it might not be obvious
  how one might reproduce an existing CLI's feature using a different library within
  cappa.

  This folder within the repo contains a number of completely standalone example
  CLIs exercising various notable cappa design patterns and features.

- [Example by case study](./case_study.md)

  This is example a meant to show a bit more of a stream of consciousness tutorial
  of sorts of how one might go from an empty python file to a CLI which does a
  thing, and design decisions or evolutions that happen along the way.
